		<h1>Love Letter</h1>
		<p id="loveNote">Dear Beloved,<br><br>
			After all the battles we fought together, after all the difficult times we saw together, after all the good and bad moments we've been through, I think it's time I let you know how I feel about you.<br><br>
			You complete my darkness with your light. You are my sunshine, my rainbow, and my everything.<br><br>
			<strong>I love you.</strong><br>
			Your not-so-secret-lover,<br>
			Batman<br></p>
